## AWS Internet of Things

AWS IoT is a managed cloud service that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. AWS IoT can support billions of devices and trillions of messages, and can process and route those messages to AWS endpoints, such as AWS Lambda and Amazon Kinesis, and to other devices reliably and securely.
