## AWS Internet of Things

AWS IoT is a managed cloud service that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. AWS IoT can support billions of devices and trillions of messages, and can process and route those messages to AWS endpoints, such as AWS Lambda and Amazon Kinesis, and to other devices reliably and securely.

In this session we will show how to build a simple example using Intel Edison with Grove Kit. You'll learn how AWS IoT provides secure device registration and communication, a rules engine for integration and device shadows for state management of eventually connected devices. Come and see how simple it can be to develop connected embedded systems with AWS IoT.
